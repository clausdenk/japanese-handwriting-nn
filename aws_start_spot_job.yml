# This ansible playbook will launch a deep learning ami as spot instance on aws, download 
# this repo from github to the instance and run run_all.sh which in turn starts run_job.sh. Outputs 
# run_job.out.txt and output.txt as well as weights are saved to s3. When the job is done,
# run_all.sh shuts the instance down which will also terminate it automatically
